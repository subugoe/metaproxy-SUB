# VirtualHost template
# Note: to use the template, rename it to /etc/apache2/vhost.d/yourvhost.conf. 
# Files must have the .conf suffix to be loaded.
#
# See /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2/README.QUICKSTART for further hints 
# about virtual hosts.
#
# NameVirtualHost statements can be added to /etc/apache2/listen.conf.
#
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for requests without a known
# server name.

    # Optionally, include *.conf files from /etc/apache2/conf.d/
    #
    # For example, to allow execution of PHP scripts:
    #
    # Include /etc/apache2/conf.d/mod_php4.conf
    #
    # or, to include all configuration snippets added by packages:
    # Include /etc/apache2/conf.d/*.conf


    # ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
    # ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
    # documents in the realname directory are treated as applications and
    # run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the client.
    # The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias directives as to
    # Alias.
    #
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/srv/www/sru/cgi-bin/"

    # "/srv/www/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
    # CGI directory exists, if you have one, and where ScriptAlias points to.

    # UserDir: The name of the directory that is appended onto a user's home
    # directory if a ~user request is received.
    #
    # To disable it, simply remove userdir from the list of modules in APACHE_MODULES
    # in /etc/sysconfig/apache2.
    #
    <IfModule mod_userdir.c>
	# Note that the name of the user directory ("public_html") cannot simply be
	# changed here, since it is a compile time setting. The apache package
	# would have to be rebuilt. You could work around by deleting
	# /usr/sbin/suexec, but then all scripts from the directories would be
	# executed with the UID of the webserver.
	UserDir public_html
	# The actual configuration of the directory is in
	# /etc/apache2/mod_userdir.conf.
	Include /etc/apache2/mod_userdir.conf
	# You can, however, change the ~ if you find it awkward, by mapping e.g.
	# http://www.example.com/users/karl-heinz/ --> /home/karl-heinz/public_html/
	#AliasMatch ^/users/([a-zA-Z0-9-_.]*)/?(.*) /home/$1/public_html/$2
